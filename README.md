## Background/About
While there are many apps out there to track your scores while playing golf, there are no apps that track your practice habits and performance. This app allows users to assess their performance shot-by-shot, while also promoting a slower pace to practicing and a randomized club selection, which is designed to mimic the actual pace of a round of golf. 

This app also features several opportunities for monetization, including a marketplace for local golf professionals, affiliate marketing for premium online content, and eventual brand takeovers from golf manufacturers. 

## Primary Technologies Used
- React
- Redux
- SCSS
- Jest
